# Z2R_Mapper
Shows item locations, overworld maps, and other details for ROM files generated by the Zelda II Randomizer.<br>
Documentation [here](https://github.com/AFontaine79/Z2R_Mapper_Docs/wiki/Zelda-2-Randomizer-Mapper).<br>
<br>
Note, this project has separate repos for the program and the wiki.  Since the [issues](https://github.com/AFontaine79/Z2R_Mapper_Docs/issues) page in the wiki repo is already being used, I am going to keep it this way.
